* Just C# project that simulates buying a plan
* payment simulation system is just badly patched (i didn't have much time)
* works with postgresql
* does email verification (and payment system is messed up ._. i'm proud of myself)
* 3 different projects (i don't even know why)
* tried to write tests failed miserably (i already lacked in the timing department, its probably just an excuse)
* all and all it got me to appreciate how better Spring boot is
