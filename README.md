* Just C# project that simulates bying a plan
* payment system is just badly patched (i didn't have much time)
* works with postgresql
* 3 diffrent projects (i don't even know why)
* tried to test failed (i already lacked in the timing department)
* all and all it got me to appreciate how better Spring boot is
